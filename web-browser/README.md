# web-browser

Basic application taking advantage of Actions and Outlets.
This uses Storyboards.

## Notes
* Create an Outlet or Action by control + click dragging from the Storyboards onto the source code.
* Be careful not to layout everything in the LauncScreen.storyboard. Limited and odd functionality will be here, but it will look pretty similar to laying out things on the Main storyboard.
* When in the text field, if you hit 'enter, execute some code by implementing the UITextFieldDelegate (or the easy way is to use a more encompassing Action).

## Comments
* There is a Stack implementation let in the code that is not used. I was going to use this to implement 'Back' functionality, until I realied it was built into the webView.
