# photo-picker

This project is meant to utilize the use of Delegates.

## Notes
* After re-assigning the image on the phone simulator, the functionality will initially fail on the iPad due to not handling the Delegates properly. The Delegate overriding will allow the ImagePicker overlay to properly find an anchor and display on iPad without crashing.
